Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

**The 5 positions in Baketball**

**1. Point Guard** ![alt text](https://i0.wp.com/basketballsocietyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cp3-e1482565510722.jpg?fit=900%2C665&ssl=1)

The point guard (PG), also called the one or the point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to the position of quarterback in Gridiron football. They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game.

**2. Shooting Guard** ![alt text](https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/358/979/hi-res-d92b6dc2e02c2456b4a8944aa8cb4003_crop_north.jpg?1429046995&w=3072&h=2048)

The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two, two guard or off guard,[1] is one of the five traditional positions in a regulation basketball game. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense.[1] Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards.[2] A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman.[3] In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) to 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) while in the WNBA, shooting guards tend to be between 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)


**3. Small Forward**

The small forward (SF), also known as the three, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game.[1] Small forwards are typically shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers but taller, larger, and stronger than either of the guard positions.[1] They are strategic and are often relied upon to score, defend, create open lanes, and rebound for their team.

**4. Power Forward** ![alt text](https://library.sportingnews.com/2021-08/giannis-antetokounmpo-getty-072121-ftrjpg_1bf2fdd9wvdzn1x5r92j25uiw8.jpg)

The power forward (PF), also known as the four or strong forward, is one of the five traditional positions in a regulation basketball game. Power forwards play a role similar to centers. When on offense, they typically play with their backs towards the basket. When on defense, they typically position themselves under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense.[4] The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, including rebounding, screen setting, rim protecting, and of course, scoring.[5] Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m). Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals

**5. Center** ![alt text](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/USATSI_21659884_168402036_lowres-1024x683.jpg)

The center (C), or the centre, also known as the five or the pivot, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the NBA, the center is typically close to 7 feet (2.13 m) tall. They traditionally play close to the basket in the low post. The tallest players to play the position in NBA history are Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, both of whom stood at 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m) tall.
